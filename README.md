# Brahma
Brahma is an open-source, cross-platform XR engine written in modern C++ and structured to be fast, simple, and extremely modular.

Vulkan is the sole graphics API, Vulkan can be accessed in apps with the provided XR rendering pipeline. Metal is supported through [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK).

This project is being worked on part-time by a single developer, this is under heavy development, expect bugs, API changes, and plenty of missing features.
